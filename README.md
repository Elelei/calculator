# calculator
This is a simple program written in Dart that has an input section where the user can input any value of interest. The functionality of the code is to calculate using arthimetic operators and display the results to the user at long run.
The program is interactive and easy to understand since it's a straight foward program.
Have fun interacting with the program :)
